# Project-3 Reddit API Machine Learning Project
Scope:
  - Visualizations
  - Data collection 
  - Data cleanup 
  - Api Use

## Description 
The goal of this project was to develop a model that could identify a reddit title related to Donald Trump in the years of his presidency and decide whether it was positive, negative or neutral. The goal was to use fresh data gathered from the reddit API and the subreddit r/PoliticalDiscussion to train the model then, come up with interesting and relevant graphs uing said data. 
## Limitations 
There was many issues that came up as we worked with the data with the most important one being that we did not have the necessary manpower to properly go through thousands of posts to see whether they were positive, negative or neutral. This limited the model's accuracy. In addition, despite efforts to get consistent guidelines for the project, the grading was inconsistent with many titles that one of our members would deem positive another one of members deemed negative and etc. At the end of the day, our accuracy for predicting was only at 40% to 50% or so which is not the greatest results for a model. This was a group project for a class so we had a limited amount of time to properly finish the data and set up the website correctly. 
## Concepts to Learn 
The overall goal of this project was to figure out how to develop a pipeline that could take fresh Reddit data and incorporate into a model. In addition, develop a site that could use fresh titles from user submitted requests. We also learned about the painstaking process of taking data directly from an online source like Reddit and transforming it to something useful for a machine learning model. Another difficult process that we learned specially with human submitted data is figuring out the right words to use as stopwords to parce out unnecessary fluff words that woulf affect the model.
